- **ATS Scoring Agent**: Implements consistent scoring algorithms with weighted categories and benchmarking  
- **Job Description Analyzer**: Advanced analysis with LLM processing and regex fallback for requirement extraction
- **Improvement Recommendation Agent**: Generates prioritized, actionable suggestions with effort/impact analysis
- **Visualization Agent**: Creates professional interactive charts, dashboards, and exportable reports

### Advanced System Components
- **Database Operations**: SQLite-based storage for resumes, scoring history, job templates, and user sessions
- **RAG Knowledge Base**: Industry-specific knowledge retrieval with skill taxonomy and historical patterns
- **Session Management**: User session tracking with resume history and personalization

### Technology Stack
